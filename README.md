# React + Vite

Created portfolio project with:

  - React
  - Vite
  - JSON server 
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Kind of npm packages such as :
        - react-spinners
        - react toastify
        - react router dom
        - react icons

    I have used in my little project the some of react hooks as useState and useEffect.
    Fetched datas , fake api server...


    # Thanks to Brad Traversy for his teaching. Learning and understanding the basis of the React library is simply like cooking an egg :)
